# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description
This project, created by **Cynthia M.**, explores global COVID-19 trends using open-source data. It aims to identify key patterns in infection rates, death tolls, and vaccination progress, while also examining how economic and demographic factors influenced the pandemicâ€™s impact across different countries. The analysis combines visualizations and statistics to support data-driven public health strategies.
